            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>We are a team of diverse, interdisciplinary scientists interested in studying, understanding, and drugging proteins with extreme conformational dynamics to address human disease. We are based in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/structural-and-molecular-biology">Department of Structural & Molecular Biology</a> at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London</a>.

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>30% of the human proteome is ‘undruggable’ because we lack data about how certain biomolecules, called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), interact with drugs. IDPs are highly involved in many incurable diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and diabetes. We study the role of IDPs in disease and how drugs and drug-like molecules interact with these dynamic proteins, with the ultimate goal of unleashing their enormous therapeutic potential.</p>

            <h2>How We Do It</h2>
            <p>Traditional methods in structural biology (e.g. AlphaFold2, X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy) are insufficient to fully characterise the structural ensembles of IDPs and their druggabilities because of the highly dynamic nature of these proteins. Instead, we use a combination of experimental techniques (e.g. nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, biophysical methods) and computational approaches (e.g. molecular dynamics simulations) to answer important questions about the roles of IDPs in disease and discover novel therapeutic interventions.</p>
